          At KMW, we’ve had tremendous success working with kids from
          single-parent families or adoptive arrangements. Our residential setup
          means we can offer respite care for as long as it takes, giving
          parents and guardians a much-needed break and allowing the kids to
          socialize and have fun with a supportive, creative group.
        </p>

          Every adult remembers what it was like to be a kid, but every kid is
          different. Trauma such as bereavement at a young age can call for
          years of intensive support, which may be more than any single
          caregiver can provide. KMW helps relieve that burden and the guilt
          that comes with it.
